PYTHON LISTS AND DICTIONARIES
New Entries
Like Lists, Dictionaries are mutable. This means they can be changed after they are created. 
One advantage of this is that we can add new key/value pairs to the dictionary after it is created like so:

dict_name[new_key] = new_value
An empty pair of curly braces {} is an empty dictionary, just like an empty pair of [] is an empty list.

The length len() of a dictionary is the number of key-value pairs it has. Each pair counts only once, 
even if the value is a list. (That’s right: you can put lists inside dictionaries!)
