"""

This is KEY!
You can also use a for loop on a dictionary to loop through its keys with the following:

# A simple dictionary
d = {"foo" : "bar"}

for key in d: 
  print d[key]  # prints "bar" 
Note that dictionaries are unordered, meaning that any time you loop through a dictionary, 
you will go through every key, but you are not guaranteed to get them in any particular order.
